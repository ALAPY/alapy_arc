Version 1.2.0
    * Added compresion level option (-l/--level):
       * b/best - best compression ratio, .ac file is 1.5-4 times smaller than with gzip, but 4-6 times slower than gzip, requires 1500MB of memory
       * m/medium - medium level of compression (3-5% bigger .ac file than on best level), 1.2-1.8 slower than gzip, requires 100MB of memory (default)
       * f/fast - fastest compression, 0.5-1.4 of gzip speed, .ac file is 4-10% bigger than on best level, requires 100MB of memory

Version 1.1.4
    * Fixed temporary data cleaning on SIGPIPE

Version 1.1.3
    * Fixed temporary data cleaning on SIGINT (Cntrl+C), SIGTERM and SIGABRT signals
    * Fixed output file name for cases of stdin compression with no name specified with -n option

Version 1.1
    * Added ability to output results of decompression to stdout (see help for the -d / - decompress option)   
    * Added ability to compress data from stdin (see help for the -c / - compress option)    
    * Changed input validation module for stdin/stdout support   
    * Improved synchronization of threads (compression speed increased on average by 15%)
    * Changed data decompression module (decompression speed on average increased by 30%)
    * Optimized intermediate data decompression to write directly to output file or stdout
    * Fixed end of line characters handling
    * Fixed comparison of reads headers and comments

Version 1.0
    * Initial version
    * Compression and decompression of single files
    * Change output directory and/or output file name
    * Add version to output file if it already exists
